/*
POC - Peace Officer Corps
The POC maintains order and security across the vast Peace River Protectorate. Many
a citizen, Riverans and Badlanders alike, view answering calls to assist the POC with
honor. Stories of being deputized by a POC officer are usually told with pride. In the
Badlands, the POC represents freedom from chaos and horror. POC officers are often
treated with great respect and dignity. Their meals, lodging fees and many other things
are frequently, on the house.
* Special Issue: Greyhounds may be placed in GP, SK, FS, RC or SO units.
* ECM Specialist: One gear or strider per combat group may improve its ECM to
ECM+ for 1 TV each.
* Olâ€™ Trusty: Pit Bulls and Mustangs may increase their GU skill by one for 1 TV each.
* Peace Officers: Gears from one combat group may swap their rocket packs for
the Shield trait. If a gear does not have a rocket pack, then it may instead gain the
Shield trait for 1 TV.
* G-SWAT Sniper: One gear with a rifle, per combat group, may purchase the
Improved Gunnery upgrade for 1 TV each, without being a veteran.
* Mercenary Contract: One combat group may be made with models from North,
South, Peace River, and NuCoal (may include a mix from all four factions) that have
an armor of 8 or lower.
