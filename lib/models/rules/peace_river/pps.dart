PPS - Paxton Private Securities
The Paxton Private Securities LLC offers private contractors at a good rate. After all, if
you can’t afford your own army made with the best of Paxton’s offerings, maybe you
can rent their forces at competitive rates instead. While held in reserve for the highest
bidder, discounts are available during times of peace to ensure they stay well practiced.

Z Ex-POC: Choose any one upgrade option from the POC.

for their models without being veterans; Improved Gunnery, Dual Guns, Brawler,
Veteran Melee upgrade, or ECCM.
Z Sub-Contractors: One combat group may be made with models from North,
South, Peace River, and NuCoal (may include a mix from all four factions) that
have an armor of 8 or lower.
