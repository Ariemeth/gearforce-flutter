Some faction rules apply to all models of that faction such as Task Built which all northern models can take.  Even if it is taken as part of a peace river force, a northern model should be able to take this rule.
not sure this is true anymore

may need to add a way to ignore all validation checks until after a roster is loaded.  

add force leader to printed sheets including the unit card

Maybe add a button that allows mods to be added to a unit before they are drug into the roster?  This could allow you to select a SO allowed mod.
