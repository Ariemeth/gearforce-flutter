add a way to select a force leader (highest level unless 2 are equal then player needs to select)

maybe move availableFactionMods to factionrule overrides?
maybe move rule checks for available unit filters to factionrule overrides?
would it make sense to move combatGroupSettings function into factionrule overrides?

Possible to drop tags completely and use the unitfilters as part of the canbeadded to unit check.  filters could be added to the various faction rules/combat group options.
