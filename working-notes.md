may need to add a way to ignore all validation checks until after a roster is loaded.  

add force leader to printed sheets including the unit card

Maybe add a button that allows mods to be added to a unit before they are drug into the roster?  This could allow you to select a SO allowed mod.

the following rules may need to be changed to work on models of the faction not just a faction force
* North: Task Built
* CEF: Minverva, Advanced Interface Network
* Caprice: Dueling Mounts, Advanced Interface Network, Cybernetic Upgrades
* Utopia: Drone Matrix, Manual Control, Drone Hacking, Expendable
* Eden: Lancers, Joust You Say?

After figuring out the model rules above, update Utopia CAF and OUF rules that restrict CEF model rules
